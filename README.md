# Tarot-AI 🔮   

### Main Idea
Create a bot for daily tarot card readings

### Overview    
The website includes four types of tarot bots:

**🤖 Prompt-based Bot**    
This bot uses various prompting techniques to generate predictions: meta-prompting & prompt-chaining    

**👾 Keyword-based Bot**    
This bot focuses on keywords taken from parsed tarot card meanings. It creates predictions based on the most common themes linked to each card   

**⚙️ Summarization Bot**    
This bot generates summaries from parsed tarot card meanings. It combines various summaries for a single cart, creating a single & general interpretation    

### Goal
The goal of the project is to offer a fun and unique experience for tarot fans

### About
The page shows the process of creating the bot and highlights the differences between versions. It is not the final product for use

### Winning Bot
Prompt-based or Summarization-based

### Future Developments
- Create Hybrid version of Bot (Keyword & Summarization)

- Creating training and test datasets for keyword extraction and summarization tasks

- Building a larger database of parsed tarot card interpretations, categorized by different theme

- Create a back-end & deploy it as a Telegram App

- Make an API-calls cheaper
