general,"The Ten of Swords indicate a major disaster of some sort. It shows that a certain force of extreme magnitude has come to hit you in your life - one that you may have not foreseen. There is a sense of betrayal that is indicated here, for the character is stabbed in the back. This seems to be a reminder that despite how much we try, we cannot control everything - there are things that are beyond our ability to change. Here, this situation is unavoidable. The tale of the suit of swords is a powerful metaphor, one that ends in tragedy. The swords are a symbol of the intellect, of intelligence and logic, and yet we find the final culmination of this suit a complete and total defeat of the spirit. We must realize that the swords are a weapon that can have immense potential for destruction or for good. The story as it unfolds from the ace to the ten is one where an untrained individual uses this weapon for faulty reasons - makes many mistakes, and then spends an entire lifetime attempting to run away from the power that he misused. This person believes the swords are external to him when they are part of him, and when they inevitably return, he once again suffers. His pain is not the pain of his circumstances usually, but the pain of fear, of anxiety, of not being able to be a master of his surroundings. After the hopelessness of the nine of swords, what could have happened? Were you overwhelmed by the pressure? Or did you take the final sword upon yourself and admit defeat? The Ten of Swords depicts that situation where your mentality is ‘poor me’, you feel like there is nothing you can do. Pause and remember that as with the death card, the end of something means a new beginning. Let go of what you have lost, and focus on the new path forward because that is where your life is meant to go.

Most individuals panic when you even mention the name of the card because they are afraid it will pass out and expire as soon as it appears. Relax! One of the most advantageous cards in the deck is the Death card. The Death card represents the end of a significant phase or element of your existence that you recognise is no longer functioning after pausing and reflecting with The Hanged Man, allowing room for something far more precious and important. To open another door, the first one must be shut. You must leave the past behind and separate ways prepared to seize fresh chances and opportunities.

You may feel pain physically and emotionally if you refuse to accept these essential ends, but if you use your imagination to picture a different scenario, you enable more positive patterns to form.

The Death Major Arcana card may suggest that you and your spouse need to make significant adjustments and let go of old habits or concerns if your relationship is not working out. It may also suggest that it may be best to eliminate things. The ingrained problems that the Death card aims to resolve can be excruciating. In such a scenario, relationship counselling could be something you want to think about. The outcome depends on if you and your spouse are both open to accepting the transition and truly want the connection to persist because you respect each other instead of because you are afraid of not being part of the relationship. The Death Tarot card might signify an unexpected shift, such as a sudden engagement or pregnancy, which you may first find overwhelming. These changes can also be great for a relationship.

You might be required to defend yourself or someone else, whether it's you or someone else. This card can also indicate self-victimisation, which indicates that the disputes may actually be the result of your perception of the circumstances rather than the actual events. Be very aware of your own actions and how they impact this atmosphere since defensive behaviour frequently starts an aggressive loop. The Five of Swords in a tarot card reading session denotes that there is a struggle at work. When this Minor Arcana card appears, you can anticipate stress, tension, disputes, and antagonism brought on by shoddy or nonexistent communication. You can feel discouraged as you should quit, or that you need to change occupations as a result of this. The Five of Swords can be quite unfavourable and represent bullying, intimidation, or harassment, as well as possible dishonest or shady behaviour. You can find yourself in a situation where you have to defend yourself or fight back. Keep your cool and adopt a logical strategy.",Five of Swords,website_3
finance,"Right now, you might be having financial disagreements with your partner, your family, or your friends. Right now, you need to be extremely careful with your money, especially when it comes to trusting other people. There might be people out there trying to take advantage of you or take more from you than they should. This card may occasionally indicate that you need to make some luxury spending cuts because money is tight right now. Ahead, the Five of Swords upright suggests that there may be some dishonest or shady financial activities. So, be careful who you trust, and make sure you are conducting any financial transactions fairly and legally. Any current financial difficulties are likely to make you feel hopeless, but you need to consider how they came to be. If so, you don't need to linger on them; just admit them, absorb the lessons from them, and go on to make better decisions. You might only need to give up a few indulgences until your financial situation gets better.",Five of Swords,website_3
general,"The Five of Swords is generally not a good omen because it might signify failure, change, surrender, and walking away. From the Suit of Swords, this tarot card shows self-sabotage, shady behaviour, deception, and poor communication. Intense conflict, tension, and a lack of communication can also be represented by it. Also, this tarot card upright comes with caution because it can indicate circumstances we'd prefer to avoid in our lives, such as antagonism, aggression, intimidation, and violence. On the other side, it might simply signify the course of action one must take to face challenges from others, such as standing up for oneself and defending oneself. As a result, it might be a sign of success. If so, the victory it stands for will be fought for, and you will have a tough fight ahead of you. The card has a pretty unfavourable representation of ambition. Too much ambition without real consideration for the effects of the people you have on is never a good thing. This card's misplaced ambition might make you a harsh winner or a sad loser, both of which have pretty unfavourable connotations. Instead, this card encourages us to set aside our egos and show greater consideration for the people in our lives.",Five of Swords,website_3
love,"The Five of Swords in a love tarot card reading indicates unfavourable consequences if you are in a relationship since it can portend disagreements, animosity, and significant conflict due to poor communication. This card might represent infidelity and cheating because it is a Minor Arcana card of deception and self-destructive behaviour. As it can reflect failure and go away, it can also be a sign of divorce or separation. You shouldn't have to fear your partner, and if you do, this indicates that there is a severe problem. Ahead, this tarot card upright also indicates unexpected shifts and unpleasant emotions. Arguments and confrontations may easily break out because of the tension and demands that may be present. You both might be agitated, and if you don't exercise caution, a fight could easily break out. If you ever find yourself in one of these situations, you should stop and consider why you're fighting and make sure that you're not just arguing to win. Your ego may cause an unfounded conflict between you and your loved one. When passion is desperately needed, this might sometimes spark it, but if it persists, it could be harmful.",Five of Swords,website_3
career,"If the five of wands upright comes up for you, the competitive and conflicting aspects of the cards are going to be applied to your career. This constant competition could be because of the line of work you are in, such as banking, and sales or you could also be an athlete. In these jobs, you always have to be active and moving, to keep up with your peers. Now, if you are not someone with these jobs, and competition is not a regular or usual thing for you in work, this card indicates a temporary situation where you have to be competitive or conflicts might arise. Maybe, it is due to an argument or disagreement that recently occurred in your work with your colleagues and partners, or you are competing against someone to get a raise or position. But, keep in mind that these problems are not permanent. The tarot card five assures you that you are capable enough to overcome any challenge or opponent, and will successfully remove any obstacles that are standing between you and your success.",Five of Wands,website_3

You might have to work more than usual and give a significant amount of energy to your work to maintain financial comfort.

If this card appears, this means that even if you are not particularly struggling with money, and are quite comfortable for now, prepare yourself beforehand, and you might soon have to worry about your financial state. You might end up in arguments about your money, such as someone from your family, or someone related to money such as a clerk or a shopkeeper. Either way, it will be a stressful experience for you, because you will find it hard to deal with the most minor financial situation like making a return or getting reimbursed, etc.",Five of Wands,website_3
general,"The five of wands upright can represent a form of conflict in your life, as can be seen in the image of the card. The conflict could be already in your life, or it can be something that has been building up for a while now and is about to blow up. This card also depicts miscommunication that has been happening in your life, such as no one being ready to listen to the other person’s perspective resulting in the conflict growing and failing to reach a solution. The five of wands tarot card can mean that you are working in a group, where everyone is impatient and only wants themselves to be heard and taken seriously. They don’t want to listen to others and keep doing what they want to do, which ends up in an argument. If the card shows up for you, it’s a sign that you should take the initiative first to take the situation in your hand and suggest everyone else communicate with each other, and understand what everyone is trying to say, one at a time. Everyone should get an equal chance to say what they want, without anyone interrupting. This is the only way to end the conflict and argument, by listening to everyone and finding a solution, which is suitable for everyone. The appearance of the five of wands upright in a tarot card reading indicates that you are about to come across a competition, in a field you are not much used to. Chances are that you will meet someone at school or work, who has the same abilities or qualities as you and try to take your place in the hierarchy. You will feel threatened by them, and it can make way for jealousy, envy, and greed in you. The five of wands encourage you to take the competition healthily, without malice or anger towards them. Don’t take it too seriously and take it as a learning experience. The appearance of five of wands upright also indicates a personal struggle that you have been going through, and it’s taking a toll on you. To relieve yourself from this difficult situation, you need to confront this problem first. Running away from it won’t be any help. Try to understand why it is such a bother. Only then will you be able to find a solution.",Five of Wands,website_3

This person has more suitors than you would like them to and it is upsetting you. Now you have to participate in a competition, to get their affection. But this card suggests that you have to be subtle while you pursue them, and don’t go overboard with your emotions, as this might end up discouraging your potential partner more than grabbing their attention. If you are already in a relationship, be careful about arguments and conflicts. If any of you is stressed, a small disagreement might turn into a very big argument. Although these arguments or disagreements are not very serious, they might create strain in your relationship. Try to think rationally and analyse whether what you are fighting about is a very important thing for the two of you and vital for your relationship.

You will discover that things happen if you put your attention on yourself, are grateful for what you currently have, and are open to the possibilities around you. If the four cups appear in a tarot reading about your profession, you can experience disorientation and distance at the office. It could be challenging to maintain concentration or feel motivated for projects. Your mood may be suffering from this boredom. It could be challenging to be productive if you feel bad about yourself. The tremendous monotony you presumably experience doesn't help any of this. The problem may have its roots in this stagnation.

In some circumstances, this could be a legitimate worry, but don't take it too far. It may also mean that you are clinging to an unfulfilling job out of fear of losing it. The upright Four of Pentacles may also be interpreted as somebody holding stuff back from you, such as a boss holding back a raise or wage increase. Owning a business might be a sign that you are succeeding via sincere effort and development on it.

You may be still feeling a little apprehensive about your career if you've had trouble in the past finding this stability or if this is your first employment.

You actively manage your finances and save money to build wealth and have a good life both now and in the future. You are concerned about your long-term financial stability. Consider creating a savings strategy, household expenses, retirement pension, and secure investments to safeguard your wealth accumulation and gradually raise your net worth. But the Four of Pentacles frequently indicates an attitude of scarcity, particularly when it comes to money and material belongings. You decide to hoard your money instead of spending it and living a nice life because you're afraid you could lose it all or somebody else may steal it from you. Your spending plan may be so restrained or stringent that it eliminates many of life's joys, such as vacations, social gatherings, presents, or enjoyable hobbies, but why? Instead of being hoarded away, money performs admirably when it can circulate and be exchanged. Because you don't want to risk any of your wealth and chose to sell out for an excessively safe option, you may subconsciously comprehend that you are sacrificing satisfaction and enjoyment in your life. The Four of Pentacles might also indicate that you are valuing money and material belongings excessively. You could grow overly dependent on material stuff and let them rule your life. Your self-worth is determined by your income, the vehicle you drive, the value of your property, and the location of your vacations. The Four of Pentacles' greater lesson is to respect and honour money, but not to become so enamoured of it that you lack the perspective of what matters most to you: relationships, family, pleasure, and love.

Is it just that things appear to be worse than they are?  If you're having financial difficulties, the Hanged Man is a sign that you need to change your perspective. There may be good things happening for you in other areas that you are not aware of because you are too focused on your finances, or your financial anxiety may be causing them to appear. Because it is a card of patience, the Hanged Man tarot card frequently appears in money and career readings when things aren't going as planned. This can occasionally result in a promotion not being offered or delivered as expected. It can also represent the slow and steady expansion of a company that was expected to take off.

Things will improve if you continue to put forth consistent effort.",Hanged Man,website_3
general,"The Hanged Man reminds us that sometimes we have to put everything on hold before we can move forward, or else the Universe will take action for us (and not always when it's convenient!). The adage ""What got you here won't get you there"" may have crossed your mind, and it certainly applies to this card. The Hanged Man asks you to let go of outdated mental models and behavioural habits that no longer serve you in order to perceive your environment from a new perspective and take advantage of new opportunities that would have otherwise been hidden from you if you hadn't applied the breaks. This is the issue. These ""pauses"" can be intentional or unintentional. If you're in tune with your intuition, you'll recognise when it's time to put things on hold and apply the brakes before things get out of hand. If you're out of harmony and blind to those intuitive cues, the Universe will likely put things on hold for you in the form of ongoing challenges, sickness, and breakdowns. If you ignore the 'pause' as it approaches, the universe will turn up the volume until you can no longer ignore it. If The Hanged Man appears in a Tarot reading, your projects and activities may come to an abrupt and unexpected halt. Don't keep moving forward in the hope that more power will propel you in the desired direction. Accept the opportunity to pause and use it to reassess where you are in your journey. You won't be able to see what's forming unless you give it the time and space it requires.",Hanged Man,website_3
love,"The Hanged Man is commonly associated with sacrifice, new insights, and patiently waiting for the right moment. Nothing should be rushed, according to the upright Hanged Man tarot love interpretation for singles. It doesn't matter how much you put into your romantic endeavours or how well you communicate with your date if the other person isn't ready. Rather than rushing or pressuring a relationship to develop, use this time to observe how your perspective shifts when you are alone. The same is true for interpersonal relationships. Timing can be an issue when it comes to having important conversations or developing your relationship further. Alternatively, the concept of sacrifice may be important in your current or future relationships. When assistance is required, your commitment may be tested, but these situations can also strengthen your relationship. If you are in a relationship, The Hanged Man in a love Tarot reading suggests that you are dissatisfied with how things are going in your relationship right now. It could also mean that you or your spouse need to take a step back from the relationship to consider your options or the direction you want the relationship to take.

You may need to reconsider your expectations for your relationship and focus on what you like about it now rather than what you don't.",Hanged Man,website_3

In terms of money, now is a good time to be more responsible with your spending and saving. You may be realising that money does not make you happy right now.

For instance, if you experienced a car accident as a young person and didn't deal with your feelings, you could experience sadness or anxiety each time you sit in the backseat of a vehicle. Connect to your subconscious mind to let go of any concerns or anxieties preventing you from moving forward. This procedure can be assisted by hypnosis, counselling, and shamanic healing.

For anyone who pulls out the Seven of Cups in the upright position, know that it is a chance to make the changes in your career that you have always been wanting to. Don't like your job? Maybe find another one. Don't like the overall concept of job? Maybe start a business. Things will certainly fall in place for you.",Seven of Cups,website_3
finance,"In the financial context, the upright Seven of Cups means that in the coming days, you will have multiple opportunities to make money. It is also a sign that money might come to you from different sources. Yet, as the nature of the card indicates, one should always make sure to inspect any investment opportunities thoroughly and look for consultation in order to make a wise choice. Also, the card is a signal that you might want to consider investing in your future. This way, you will have one less thing to worry about as you grow old. The Seven of Cups is not just about opportunities to earn but also how you spend. There are always some choices available when it comes to spending money, but not all of them are considerable. The card thus wants you to relook at your spending to save yourself from any future cash crunch.",Seven of Cups,website_3
general,"When the tarot reader pulls out the upright Seven of Cups card for you, know that you have many opportunities and choices to choose from ahead of you. However, the Tarot must also warn you that these choices are not free of illusion and unrealistic ideals. So though an opportunity may sound appealing in terms of money, power, and fame but it could completely stand parallel to your imagination once you get a grab of it. Thus the best option is to evaluate all the opportunities well and discover what is involved with each choice before pining one for yourself. The Seven of Cups card in the upright position is also a sign of the wishful thinking of the human. It means that you often think about doing something but hardly take appropriate actions to make it happen. For example, we always dream of a fitter body, but when the time comes (or say, the morning comes), we tend to snooze off the alarm. Similarly, most of us say to ourselves that we need to study but hardly take the effort to do the same. Hence, if you spend most of your time wishing, then the card is a sign that it’s time to choose just one thing and make it practically happen. You need to work your ideas on ground reality to analyse whether they look as good as they are in your mind or even practical. If you pull the upright Seven of Cups tarot card, know that it's time to focus on one thing and work on it to reach your goals. The constant hustle brings rewards, which is the ultimate meaning of the card. As the card is about unlimited opportunities, you need to learn to limit those as there is no point in trying to do everything at once. The Minor Arcana card indicates that you need to realistically look at where you are.",Seven of Cups,website_3

However, if you are in a relationship, the card is a sign that an old fling might soon pop back into your life, thus giving you double thoughts about your current relationship. The spawning back of the old love is never the best thing for your current relationship, especially if you are not over your ex. On the other hand, the upright Seven of Cups tarot card, again, speaks of the wishful thinking of the human. The card illustrates that you are too busy fantasizing about what you wish your relationship was instead of just facing the reality of it. If such wishful thinking has occupied your mind, the chances of you splitting up your current relationship at the first sign of attention from someone else are fairly more. If going through this phase, it is in your best interest to explore the things you haven't done in your relationship till now to bring back the initial “butterflies in the stomach” phase. All in all, the card further warns the natives to not pound on the first choice or opportunity they see in love but rather make an informed choice for themselves.",Seven of Cups,website_3
